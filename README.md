# PSTSS: An Efficient Lossless Graph Summarization Method for Large Streaming Graphs
Source code for PSTSS, described in the paper [An Efficient Lossless Graph Summarization Method for Large Streaming Graphs), SEKE2023

**PSTSS**  is an algorithm for lossless summarization of streaming graphs. **PSTSS** has the following advantages:
* *Efficient* * Lossless Graph Summarization Algorithm. 
* *Scalable* *: summarizing graphs with hundreds of millions of edges, requiring sublinear memory during the process.With linear scalability, PSTSS summarizes large-scale graph faster and achieves better compression than the state-of-the-art graph summarization method.
* *Extensive Experiments* *: Extensive Experiments We confirmed that PSTSS out- performs 3 state-of-the-art graph summarization algo- rithms on 6 real graphs in different domains.
